      A croissant is crescent shaped roll made with yeast-risen dough. The dough
      is typically layered with butter, then rolled, and folded several times in
      a process called lamination. The final dough is cut into triangles and
      rolled into a crescent shape.The process of lamination results in a
      layered, flaky textured roll, more like puff pastry. The main ingredients
      in a croissant are flour, yeast, salt, sugar, milk, water, eggs and
      butter. A well baked croissant should be flaky and crisp on the outside
      and tender and moist on the inside. It should be evenly baked and well
      aerated.
